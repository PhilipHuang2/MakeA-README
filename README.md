# Description

Taking a step back from creating a [Allergy Website](https://github.com/duffylaura/Particle-Problems) with [Duffy Laura](https://github.com/duffylaura), [Nichole Guan](https://github.com/ncguan), [Mai Moua](https://github.com/SkyWalkerMM26) (Check them out, they are great people!).   I want to work on something less visual.  I already know Python and Java so working with those languages seems boring.  Node JS serves as an interesting bridge between Javascript and my knowledge of backend programming languages.  Node js serves as a well of extending Javascript and writing some backend stuff with it.  I am still not too sure about why it actually does but it makes it so that I don't have to use another language for the backend and thats good enough for me.  

I am making this README generator for 2 reasons.  Read ME generator data are all user generated so I don't have to deal with data structures and all that for now.  Secondly, I am getting kinda of sick with writing these READMEs all the time.  It feels like most of the time I am a programmer, writing out code, building up HTML skeleton and the other time, I feel like a article writer, and it turns out that while I can program for a bit, my hands start hurting while typing out this read me. Hopefully this makes me do less work.
